Step 0: Apply for API key <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html">https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html</a><br>
Step 1: Familiarize yourself with <a href="https://api.census.gov/data/2016/pep/population/examples.html">examples for the population dataset</a><br>
Step 2: Execute the following zsh/bash script to grab all the state codes. You'll have to regex this into a sensible python/Java/whatever object:<br>
<pre><code>for i in {01..60}; do curl "https://api.census.gov/data/2016/pep/population?get=GEONAME&amp;for=state:$i&amp;DATE=9&amp;key=YOUR_KEY_HERE" &gt;&gt; states.out; done</code></pre><br>
Just as minor note: <b>&gt;</b> means you output to a file that is created when you run the above.  That file doesn't need to be there when you run the snippet. Two of them in a row, <b>&gt;&gt;</b> means a. create if file isn't there, b. open for writing, c. append to it.  If you don't append to the file, then only the last state found whose API return object are read by the curl command will be written to the file.  Leaving it as an exercise to the reader to understand what curl is and what the other flags are in the census link as they will undoubtedly become stale after a short period of time.<br>
Step 3: TODO: Put in this spot the exact API HTTPS endpoint that'll give you population for the greater metro area for a given metro location.  e.g. 'Reston, VA' should return, perhaps, the greater metro area's population rather than <b>just</b> Reston's population.<p>&nbsp;<p>

<hr>
<pre><code>/var/lib/docker/volumes/</code></pre> is where internal volumes for containers are stored.<p>
Make sure you always -- ALWAYS -- use external volumes for data storage or at the very least named ones.  You don't want your data being lost when you update docker.
<p><pre><code>
sudo docker run -i \<br>
    --hostname hydrogen \<br>
    --publish 8443:443 --publish 8088:80 --publish 2222:22 \<br>
    --name gitlab \<br>
    --volume /data/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab \<br>
    --volume /data/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab \<br>
    --volume /data/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab \<br>
    --restart always \<br>
    gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest</code></pre><p>
^^ That's what I used to create my gitlab container.

30 nov 2017 -- getting setup with jenkins on docker on centos7
<hr>
<code>
$ docker pull jenkins/jenkins
</code>
<p>This pulls the image from jenkins on docker hub.<p>
<code>
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts
</code>
<p>Create a jenkins_home folder for plugin management (per the github for jenkins docker page)<br>
docker run (create+start) and --name the image.<p>
<code>
$ sudo docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
</code>
<p>
That will get you the initial root password.
<br>
I haven't figured out where users and passwords are stored, so make sure you note down what your initial user and password account you create will be.
<p>
<code>
$ docker update --restart=no my-container
</code><p>

Forget to flag the container to have a restart policy?  Do it here.
<p>
Now you can just point to http://&lt;hostname_of_machine_running_jenkins&gt;:8080

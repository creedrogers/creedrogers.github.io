30 nov 2017 -- getting setup with jenkins on docker on centos7
$ docker pull jenkins/jenkins

This pulls the image from jenkins on docker hub.

$ sudo mkdir /var/jenkins_home
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:ts

Create a jenkins_home folder for plugin management (per the github for jenkins docker page)

docker run (create+start) and --name the image.

$ sudo docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

That will get you the initial root password.

I haven't figured out where users and passwords are stored, so make sure you note down what your initial user and password account you create will be.
